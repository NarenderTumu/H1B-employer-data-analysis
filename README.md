# H1B-employer-data-analysis

* Hello, my name is **Narender** and I am trying to analyze H-1B employer data which is from the [Immigration and citizenship data from USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub) and also joined the population data for that specific zipcode and that fiscal year which is obtained from [United States Census Beaureau](https://data.census.gov/table?t=Counts,+Estimates,+and+Projections&g=010XX00US$8600000&tid=ACSDT5Y2021.B01003)

* Before going into the analysis, I wanted to provide some basic information on what is a H1B visa for those who are not familiar with it.

**The H1B visa is a specialized work visa under the Immigration and Nationality Act that enables American companies to hire foreign professionals in specialty occupations. To sponsor foreign workers for this visa, employers must file petitions with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). If you want to learn more about this you can visit [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations) or [U.S.Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b) websites**

* Data can be acessed in the folder named "Files" under H1B datafiles for data related to H1B employer from 2017 to 2021 and population data can be accessed under population datafiles from 2017 to 2021 based on zipcode
