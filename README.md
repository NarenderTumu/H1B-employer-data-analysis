# H1B-employer-data-analysis

* Hello, my name is **Narender** and I am trying to analyze H-1B employer data which is from the [Immigration and citizenship data from USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub) and also joined the population data for that specific zipcode and that fiscal year which is obtained from [United States Census Beaureau](https://data.census.gov/table?t=Counts,+Estimates,+and+Projections&g=010XX00US$8600000&tid=ACSDT5Y2021.B01003)
